# Employee Management System – Django (Python)

  I developed a simple and efficient Employee Management System using Django to help manage           employee records in a clean and organized way. The system includes features to add, update,         track, and list all employees with ease.

  To enhance the UI, I also added a beautiful continuous snow-fall effect using JavaScript, giving    the application a visually appealing and modern look.


## Key Features
  1. Add New Employees
     -- User can add employee details such as.
     * Full Name
     * Designation
     * Mobile Number
     * Address
     * Employment Status (Working / Not Working)\
     * Gender
     * Email ID
     * Salary

  2. Auto-Generated Employee ID
     * Each employee receives a unique, randomly generated Employee ID.
  
  3. Update Employee Details Anytime
     * Employee data can be edited or updated at any time through the update form or admin panel.
  4. Employee List Table
     -- A clean and responsive table displays:
     * All employee
     * Designation
     * Status
     * Salary
     * Auto-generated ID

       This makes tracking employees simple and fast.
       
  5. Search / Filter Support
     * Options to easily find employees from the full list.

  6. Snowfall Animation (Frontend Enhancement)
     * A continuous JS snow effect is added across the page, giving the interface a:
         Calm
         Attractive
         Seasonal / decorative feel
       This creates a better user experience and enhances the overall visual appeal of the system.
